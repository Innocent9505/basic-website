                <p>The building is interesting as an example of the original Soweto housing built when the township was established. 
                    Small collection of artefacts, with some emphasis on Winnie Mandela. 
                    Inevitably, the house is surrounded by people selling souvenirs etc.
                    Well preserved, helpful tour guides and right in the heart of Vilakazi Street

                <h2>Hector Pieterson Memorial</h2>
                <p>The 1976 photograph of slain thirteen-year old Hector Pieterson, carried by a friend while his grieving sister runs alongside, is a chilling reminder that South African was changed thereafter.
                    Any memorial makes one ponder and more so this particular one, named after the South African schoolboy shot at the site during the Soweto uprising in which the police opened fire on students protesting the enforcement of teaching in Afrikaans. 
                    It is a reminder of a harsh period in the story of South Africa and clearly a reminder of the number of young inocent people who were sacrificed (and still are the world around) in the name of justice.

                <h2>Constitution Hill Human Rights Precinct</h2>
                <p>  Constitution Hill is a national heritage site situated in the Johannesburg CBD and is home to the Constitutional Court of South Africa- the highest court in the country on constitutional matters. 
                    Once a place of injustice and brutality, where South Africa's leading political activists, including Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi, were detained, the site has been transformed into a place of solidarity and democracy, home to the Women's Gaol museum, Number Four Museum, and Old Fort Museum. 
                    Apart from its engaging and gripping exhibitions, Constitution Hill is also open to the public for guided tours and has become an important platform for Heritage, Education, and Tourism related programmes.
